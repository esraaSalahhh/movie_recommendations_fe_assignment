# description for the updates I have made 
- In this assignment in old version ,header contain email verification and that not true then i make new page for this, but in my opinion the visitor not enter his email and wait token in all time he want see movies , then i make page for Signup and when visitor enter his email and pasword he receive token and enter this token in token.html , but if he signup exactly then he only login .

- I add also navbar that contain logo and about us , contact , news for example 
 
- And in header i but checkbox about category of movies and year and also search

- And but img instead of button next in right of movies 

- And problem for me that div of movie-list is empty but when get the code from 'inspect' was not empty for that i not able to find solve for this problem to update it
